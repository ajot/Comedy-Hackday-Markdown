From June 13-15 we'll be hosting the fourth [Comedy Hack Day](http://comedyhackday.com) ever and our second in NYC.

###What is Comedy Hack Day?

Developers and comedians spend a weekend building projects together. On Sunday night the finalists demo their projects to our panel of judges and a whiskey-filled audience. It's awesome.
